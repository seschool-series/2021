We are pleased to announce ISE School 2020, the 6th International School on Software Engineering. The main theme of this edition is AI and continuous software engineering.

The school is intended for both researchers and practitioners.

Because of the **COVID-19 crisis**, we have decided that ISE 2020 will not take place physically but will be replaced by a virtual event. Participants will remotely join live presentations and interactive sessions as well as recorded videos after the event.

The following speakers are confirmed:

Markus Borg, RISE Research Institutes and Lund University, Sweden
Andre van Hoorn, University of Stuttgart, Germany
Michael Pradel, University of Stuttgart, Germany
Baishakhi Ray, Columbia University, NY, USA

The program includes a special session where participants have the possibility to present their latest activities. We believe this represents a great opportunity for Ph.D. students, researchers, and professionals to get feedback from experts in the field and enrich the collaboration network.

The program includes also a (virtual) social event that gives to participants the opportunity to interact and have fun!

There are two registration options:
- FULL: 80 EUR and includes attendance to all tutorials and students’ presentations
- PARTIAL: 40 EUR and includes attendance to a single selected tutorial and students’ presentations

The registration fees will be used to grant an honorarium to all the guest speakers for their valuable effort.
